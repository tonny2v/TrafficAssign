Summary
=======

This project built a prototype of an advanced traveler information system 
hose objective is to reduce system cost with recurrent network congestion 
through provision of route guidance to travelers.
The design of route guidance system faces a well-known dilemma. 
The approach that theoretically yields the _system-optimal_ traffic pattern 
may _discriminate_ against some users in favor of others. 

We proposed a novel mathematical programming model to resolve this dilemma. 
The route choice behavior is modeled as a convex minimization problem and 
an efficient column generation algorithm is used to solve this mixed behavior 
equilibrium problem.

The essence of this study is that system-optimal routing of traffic flow with 
explicit integration of user constraints leads to a better performance than 
stochastic user equilibrium, while _simultaneously_ guaranteeing superior 
fairness compared to the pure system optimum.

This research is part of my undergraduate thesis in Chinese, 信息环境下的混合网络均衡模型.
